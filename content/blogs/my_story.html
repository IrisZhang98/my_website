<p>My name is Yi-Chen Zhang and I preferred to be called as Iris or Sisi. Growing up in Shanghai, China, I have spent more than 13 years living there. When I was young, I also spent years living in Taipei and Hangzhou as my parents work there. At the age of 18, I moved to Boston, USA since I was admitted to study at Boston College. I spent four years there and finally traveled to London, UK at my age of 22 as I became a MFA student at London Business School. I love to live in different corners of the world, making me more diverse and get deep into various cultures.</p>

<p>I am pretty much a foodie and loves to enjoy different kinds of food. Therefore, I love the night markets in Taiwan. Every time I stay in Taipei, my weight goes up dramatically. My favourite food there is Oyster vermicelli. Don’t forget to ask me for recommendations when you plan a trip to Taiwan! XD</p>

<p>During my spare time, I play the violin. I have practiced it for more than 16 years and joined the Shanghai Student Orchestra as a violinist. Besides playing the classical music, I also joined a Folk Metal Band. For me, it is pretty excited to use a classical instrument performing hardcore music!</p>
