<p>I had my high school Education at Shanghai World Foreign Language Academy.</p>
<p>I then moved on to study in Bachelor of Arts in Economics at Boston College. I love BC since we had very small classes there (usually 10-25 students in one class) are our campus is very pretty. I enjoyed my four years there.</p>

<p>One of the best thing I did during my undergraduate study is that I got a chance to learn Philosophy and Theology. These classes made me realize my limitation and brought me to a new horizon that strengthen my way of thinking and perception of the world.</p>
<p>My favorite professor at Boston College is Christopher McHugh. He is the best professor I have ever met as he is wise, smart, and experience. I learned about Fed and the whole US economy throughout the history and also their reactions under the current Covid-19 pandemic through his class, which is really an eye-opening experience. He really brought me to the world of Economics and Finance, making me decide to pursue a career in the finance industry. If you have brothers or sisters going to Tufts or Boston College, donâ€™t forget suggest them take his class!</p>
